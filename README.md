# Tic Tac Toe Game in JavaScript

This project is from The Odin Project: Factory Functions And The Module Pattern lesson from the Full Stack Web Development path.

This project was a fun one to build. Got more confident with my CSS skills and put in practice Factory Functions and Module Pattern in JavaScript to sharpen my programming skills.
